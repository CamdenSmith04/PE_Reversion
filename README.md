# PE_Reversion

The goal of this project is to look at stocks in specific industries. Over time, it is expected that prices of stocks will increase but P/E ratios tend to be consistent within industries over time and based off the maturity of a company. This project aims to look at the idea of whether P/E Reversion exists and is it a usable metric with predictive value.
